This notebook serves as the starting point for exploring the various resources available to help you get started with YOLOv8 and understand its features and capabilities.\n","\n","The YOLOv8 models are designed to be fast, accurate, and easy to use, making them an excellent choice for a wide range of object detection and image segmentation tasks. They can be trained on large datasets and are capable of running on a variety of hardware platforms, from CPUs to GPUs.\n","\n","Whether you are a seasoned machine learning practitioner or new to the field, we hope that the resources in this notebook will help you get the most out of YOLOv8. Please feel free to browse the <a href=\"https://docs.ultralytics.com/\">YOLOv8 Docs</a> and reach out to us with any questions or
